# DSP-Project-Reverb

## Abstract

In this paper we investigate the use of algorithmic implementations of artificial reverberation to approximate the behaviour of an existing physical model, namely a recorded impulse response of a real world reverberant environment. A series of metrics are developed in order to evaluate the performance of the algorithms when tested against the physical model, and finally, existing 
algorithms will be modified based on the results of the comparison in an attempt improve algorithmic performance. 

## Report

* A report detailing our methods and findings is avalible in the file "report.pdf"

## Audio Examples

* The "outputs" folder contains .wav files of all the results of the reverb algorithms.

* The "inputs" folder contains all the experimental data used (real room impulse response and dry anechoic sound).

## Code

* All code used in this project is in the "code" folder.
